<h1> Weather!! </h1>

<h2> Here are the Criteria! </h2>

<ul>

<li>WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history</li>
<li>WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index</li>
<li>WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe</li>
<li>WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity</li>
